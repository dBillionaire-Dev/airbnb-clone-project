### 🎯 **Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System**

A user-friendly design is **critical** to the success of a booking platform. Here's why:

- **Reduces User Frustration**: A clear and intuitive interface helps users quickly complete tasks, like searching and booking, without confusion.
- **Increases Conversions**: A streamlined and simple booking process improves the chances that visitors become paying users.
- **Builds Trust**: Visually professional and predictable interactions build user confidence in the platform’s reliability and safety.
- **Supports Accessibility**: Inclusive design ensures that users with disabilities can interact with the application effectively.
- **Minimizes Support Requests**: When users can navigate easily, they are less likely to reach out for help, reducing support overhead.

### ❗ Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Defining design properties from the mockup is essential for maintaining **visual consistency**, **development efficiency**, and **scalability** across the project. Here’s why:

- ✅ **Consistency**: Shared styles ensure a uniform look and feel throughout the app, improving brand coherence and user trust.
- 🛠️ **Developer Efficiency**: Defined tokens (colors, fonts, sizes) speed up the translation of designs into code, reducing guesswork.
- 📱 **Responsiveness**: Pre-defined styles help maintain visual harmony across different devices and screen sizes.
- 🧪 **Design-System Alignment**: Sets the foundation for a scalable design system and reusable components.
- 🧠 **Better UX**: Thoughtfully chosen colors and type enhance readability, accessibility, and user engagement.
